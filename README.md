# Doubly-Linked-List
Implementation of my own templated doubly-linked list class, along with an associated iterator class for help with generic list traversals.

The list of supported functions of my doubly-linked list class can be found in the *tlist.h* file

All work was written by Benjamin Zech. *Do not steal or plagerize*
